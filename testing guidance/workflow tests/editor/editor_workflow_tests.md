* [Workflow 1: Editor launch, Level CRUD, Entity/Component CRUD](#FoundationWorkflowTesting-Workflow1:Editorlaunch,LevelCRUD,Entity/ComponentCRUD)
* [Workflow 2: UI Layout Customization, Docking/Window Management](#FoundationWorkflowTesting-Workflow2:UILayoutCustomization,Docking/WindowManagement)
* [Workflow 3: Prefab Editing Focus Mode](#FoundationWorkflowTesting-Workflow3:PrefabEditingFocusMode)
* [Workflow 4: Read-Only Entities](#FoundationWorkflowTesting-Workflow4:Read-OnlyEntities)

Testing in this area should revolve primarily around UI/UX touchpoints with basic Editor functionality.

## Special Requirements 
Multiple Monitors (Preferably with different resolutions/Windows scaling/DPI settings)

## Project Requirements
Any, though AutomatedTesting makes life easier

## Common Issues to Watch For

Test guidance will sometimes note specific issues to watch for. The common issues below should be watched for through all testing, even if unrelated to the current workflow being tested.
1. Console log errors/warnings/spam
2. Asserts
